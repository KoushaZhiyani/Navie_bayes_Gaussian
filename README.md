# Navie_bayes_Gaussian
In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of linear "probabilistic classifiers" which assumes that the features are conditionally independent, given the target class. The strength (naivety) of this assumption is what gives the classifier its name. These classifiers are among the simplest Bayesian network models<br>
First, specify X and y your database. Use train_test_split to split your data into test and train. Build the model and specify the data_train and target feature in the model. In the predict method, send data_test. and display the score using the score method.<br>
If needed, you can also display list of classes and probability for each classes
